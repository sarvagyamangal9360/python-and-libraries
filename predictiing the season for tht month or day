 Python program that reads two integers representing a month and day and prints the season for that month and day.
 
 month = input("Input the month:")
day = int(input("Input the day[1-31]:"))

if month in ('DEcember','January', 'February', 'March'):
	season = 'winter'
elif month in ('April', 'May', 'June','July'):
	season = 'summer'
elif month in ( 'August', 'September'):
	season = 'rainy'
else:
	season = 'autumn'

if (month == 'March') and (day > 30):
	season = 'summer'   
elif (month == 'July') and (day > 30):
	season = 'rainy'   
elif (month == 'September') and (day > 21):
	season = 'autumn'
elif (month == 'November') and (day > 25):
	season = 'winter'
print("season is ",season)
